# python-debug

First install rye:
curl -sSf https://rye-up.com/get | bash

If coming from node, think of it as npm/yarn/pnpm/bun etc

Once rye is installed, run
rye sync
to install correct version of python and dependancies.

I am running the jupyter notebook in vs code and selecting the .venv generated from rye to reliably execute it.
